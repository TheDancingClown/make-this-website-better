# Make this website better

This is a coding challenge for Etch Junior Developer job applicants.

We would like you to fork this repo, make the website better and open a PR that describes what has been done and why it's better.

There's no right answer, we just want to see what you're interested in.

## Changes

Visual
* Kept styling of navbar and logo, and text/form fields (assumed client brief). 
* Used approximate logo colours for theme, aiming for vibrant colour scheme.  

UI
* Colour changing labels to confirm valid input in fields.
* Transformation effects indicating interactive links.
* Calendar for easy selection alternative with min/max dates.
* Removed links to non-existent pages. 

Performance
* Restricted to using CSS for transitions and backgrounds for faster loading.
